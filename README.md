INTRODUCTION
The entertainment industry has greatly benefited from data analysis, which has led to the identification of rating categories and increased productivity, resulting in higher revenue. Moreover, data analysis empowers viewers to access products and services that align with their preferences. Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, facilitates data analysis from various sources, making it ideal for exploring the vast collection of Netflix movies and TV shows.

2. METHODOLGY
To create a Tableau dashboard for Netflix’s content, I followed a systematic approach.

Step 1: Data Preparation
The first step is to gather the data you need. You can download the Netflix dataset from Kaggle, which includes information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix in various countries. Once you have downloaded the data, you can import it into Tableau.

Step 2: Data Analysis
After importing the data, you need to analyze it to identify patterns and insights. Tableau offers a range of visualization options, including bar charts, scatterplots, and heat maps, that can help you explore the data. Some useful questions to ask when analyzing the Netflix dataset include:

What is the distribution of movies and TV shows by genre?
Which countries have the most content available on Netflix?
What is the average rating of movies and TV shows on Netflix?
How has the content on Netflix changed over time?

3. INSIGHTS
Upon analyzing the data, several interesting insights emerged. Notably, the majority of movies and TV shows on Netflix are produced in the United States, and TV-MA-rated programs have the highest rating. Movies account for approximately 69.62% of the content, while TV shows make up the remaining 30.38%. The genre preference shows a stronger inclination towards Drama and International Movies. Furthermore, movies have consistently dominated the industry over the years.

I utilized charts to find relations between the Movies and TV Shows by;

i. Countries: The bright red show that majority of Movies and TV Shows production are from the United States of America. While few productions are made in countries showing lighter red.

ii. Rating: This indicates that TV-MA (Matured Audience Only) program have the highest rating at 3,207. While the lowest rating goes to NC-17 (Not for Children Under 17) at 3.

iii. Distribution: Indicates the distribution between Movies and TV Shows, which leave Movies as the highest 69.62% and TV Shows at 30.38%

iv. Genre: With genre is shows that viewers prefer Drama, International Movies than others.

v. Years: It indicates that Movies have always dominated the industry with higher production than TV Shows each year.

vi. I also categorized the TV show/series, The Blacklist into type, title, rating, duration, date added, description, release year, genre and release year.

ONCLUSION
Creating a Tableau dashboard for Netflix movies and TV shows is an effective way to explore the vast content library and make informed decisions about what to watch. By employing best practices in dashboard design, such as simplicity, consistency in colors and fonts, and choosing the right visualizations, the dashboard can present the data in an engaging and visually appealing manner. Overall, the dashboard serves as a valuable tool to understand Netflix’s content trends and user preferences, ultimately enhancing the viewer’s streaming experience.
